**🍕 Python Pizza Deliveries
Hey there! 👋

This is a fun little Python project I made as part of my 100 Days of Python challenge. The idea was to create a simple pizza ordering system that runs in the terminal and calculates the total bill based on what the user wants.

It's not super fancy, but it helped me practice basic Python skills like conditionals, user input, and working with variables.

🧾 What It Does
Asks you what size pizza you’d like (S, M, or L)

Lets you choose if you want pepperoni and/or extra cheese

Adds everything up and shows you the final bill

💻 Why I Built It
I’m still learning Python, and I wanted to build something simple and interactive. This was a fun way to practice using if statements, handling user input, and doing basic calculations.

Plus, pizza makes everything better. 🍕

🧠 What I Learned
How to use if, elif, and else statements

Taking and using user input with input()

Using variables to store and update data

Printing output in a nice way using f-strings

🧪 Sample Run

Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!
What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L : M
Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N : Y
Do you want extra cheese? Y or N : Y
Your final bill is: $24.
Thanks for checking out my little pizza project! More Python projects on the way soon 🚀
